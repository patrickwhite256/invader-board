# Spirit Island Invader Board

This project aims to replace the invader board in Spirit Island to reduce the setup time table space required for the game.

## Features

- Track earned fear
- Track current phase/step
- Set up and move invader cards as appropriate
- Track and reveal earned fear cards [TODO]
- Reveal events as appropriate [TODO]
- Allow inspection of the relevant discards [TODO]
- Allow setup modifications (e.g. invader deck modifications from Adversaries) [TODO]
- Track special adversary phases (France 6, Scotland 6, HME 3/5, etc)
- Allow special actions (moving/revealing cards early, fear pool modifications, etc)

## Running

This is a basic create-react-app project. To run in development mode on `localhost:3000`:

```
npm start
```

To build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```

## Disclaimer

I am not a frontend developer. I learned basically the bare minimum required to understand React for my job, so this may look very ugly to a proper developer.

## But Why?

Don't get me wrong, I love fiddling with cards and moving bits around and having the whole board.

I made this at a time when I was severely disabled and could not sit or stand comfortably, so I couldn't set up the full game in a way that I could reach.
